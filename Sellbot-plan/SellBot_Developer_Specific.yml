# STEP 4 — LEAD ASSIGNMENT & CALL ATTEMPTS
# ============================================================
step_04_lead_assignment_and_call_attempts:
  title: "Lead Assignment & Call Attempts"
  objective: >
    Ensure every new lead receives 5 structured call attempts within 5 days —
    with automatic WhatsApp messages and optional brochure/catalog attachments
    when appropriate. After the 6th message (post TL approval), unresponsive
    leads are moved to "Not Qualified" or "Marketing Nurture."

  process_flow:

    lead_assignment:
      - Every new lead is automatically assigned to a CRM Executive (Telecaller)
      - System auto-creates 5 tasks labeled Call Attempt 1 → Call Attempt 5
      - Each task remains Pending until CRM marks it Completed
      - Tasks cannot be skipped — sequential progress required
      - If a task is not completed before due time → automation sends WhatsApp message to lead automatically

    optional_attachments:
      description: "For every call attempt, CRM telecaller gets an 'Attach from Project Assets' dropdown"
      options:
        - Project Brochure (PDF)
        - Intro/Walkthrough Video
        - Google Map Location
        - Company Profile Document
        - Website & Social Media Links
      rule: "Attachments are optional — only sent if customer explicitly requests more details"
      behavior: "Once attached, auto-appends below WhatsApp message (as media + caption)"

    team_leader_review:
      trigger: "Day 6 — after 5 failed attempts"
      tl_options:
        approve_not_qualified: "System closes lead"
        retry: "Generates new 3-call batch"
      rule: "No lead moves out of CRM without TL approval"

  automation_summary:
    - 5 Auto WhatsApp Messages (Day 1–5)
    - Optional Attachments available on each message
    - 6th Final Message (Post TL Approval) — informs lead about closure
    - No email triggers (WhatsApp only for simplicity)

    title: "How to Fill the Site Visit Feedback Form & Complete Post-Visit Actions"

    before_site_visit:
      confirm_visit_details:
        - Review client details in CRM (Name, Contact, Project, Time)
        - Check Google Map link & ensure directions are correct
      prepare_professionally:
        - Dress neatly (as per company dress code)
        - Carry ID card, visiting card, and brochure copies
        - Be at site 15 minutes early
      prepare_for_client:
        - Keep project brochure and rate sheet ready
        - Know nearby landmarks and project highlights
        - Keep phone charged and internet active for CRM access

    during_site_visit:
      - "Greet client warmly — smile, use name, thank them for coming"
      - "Start visit with context: 'Let me walk you through the project and explain the highlights.'"
      - "Ask 2–3 open questions about preferences, budget, and family needs"
      - "Avoid pressure sales — be informative, not pushy"
      - "End politely: 'Would you like to take a second visit with your family?'"
      - "Note client response in phone right away"

    after_site_visit:
      step_1_capture_proof:
        - Click Client Photo at Site (geotag ON)
        - Click BDM + Client Selfie (smile, clear face)
        - Politely ask for optional signature or short acknowledgment video
        - Script: '"Sir, this is just for internal record — may I take a quick photo/video confirmation?"'
        - Upload both photos in feedback form

      step_2_fill_feedback_form:
        client_details: "Verify client name, project name, date/time"
        overall_impression:
          tip: "Choose 'Okay' only if neutral — avoid guessing"
        objection_capture:
          example_budget: "If client said 'Budget is slightly high' → tick Budget Concern"
          example_family: "If client said 'I'll come with family' → tick Family Discussion"
          description: "Write 2–3 sentences in Description"
        urgency_level:
          high: "Client said 'Will decide next week'"
          medium: "Maybe 2–3 months later"
          low: "Not now"
        next_committed_step: "Select one and date"
        notes: "Write key takeaways e.g. 'Client liked location but wants 3BHK. Will visit with wife.'"
        save_and_submit: "Click SAVE & SEND THANK-YOU after review"

      step_3_confirm_automation:
        check:
          - WhatsApp Thank You sent to client
          - Internal notification reached CRM Executive
          - Next task created

    important_tips:
      - Fill form immediately after visit — don't wait till evening
      - Don't submit without both photos — TL approval needed otherwise
      - Be accurate — avoid guessing objections
      - Respect client privacy — never post or forward photos/videos elsewhere
      - Communicate politely and end with "Thank you for visiting us"

    common_mistakes_to_avoid:
      - Forgetting to capture proof photos
      - Entering "No Objection" for everyone
      - Using casual language in feedback
      - Skipping next-step selection
      - Submitting without sending Thank You automation

    quality_standards:
      monthly_tracking:
        - "% Verified Visits (with proof)"
        - "% Timely Form Submission"
        - "% Objection Accuracy"
        - "Conversion Ratio (Visit → Booking)"
